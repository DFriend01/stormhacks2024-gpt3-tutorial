# Stormhacks 2024: Introduction to GPT-3 in Web Applications

## Overview

Welcome to the workshop! We will be focusing on using the OpenAI API to perform
text generation. The following topics will be covered:
- A brief introduction to LLMs, GPT, and the OpenAI API
- OpenAI account creation and project setup
- Text generation using the `chat.completions.create` API
- How to create a simple chatbot
- Prototyping with the OpenAI Playground
- Introduction to Prompt Engineering with examples

Most of the material will be covered in a
[notebook posted on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eq3SBle28Pjo7-e0UZxuIxZgKmLdR1JP?usp=sharing). There will be some Python programming
that we will do together, so feel free to follow along!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need to make a copy of the notebook to your own drive if you want edit the notebook
> and run the code yourself. Go to **File > Save a copy in Drive**. You will also need a Gmail
> account.

If you have not already, you should also [create an OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/login/).

Although "Web Applications" is in the title of this workshop, most of the focus will be on using
the OpenAI API and the various use cases of GPT. There is an example React application that might
be shown if there is time to spare, but there are [instructions here](./chatbot-app/README.md)
if you are interested in trying the app yourself.

## About Me

I am a recent graduate from UBC ECE and placed second in Stormhacks 2023! My project last
year is on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/watchdog-exrdgn) if you are interested.
Using GPT was instrumental to the success of the project.
